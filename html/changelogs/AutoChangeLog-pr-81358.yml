changes:
  - qol: "adds examines & screentips for crowbar, screwdriver acts to BRM & refinery machines"
  - qol: "adds examines about the number of boulders stored & processed to BRM & refinery machines"
  - qol: "BRM now has its lights turn on/off depending on wether automatic boulder retrieval is on/off for visual clarity along with examines"
  - qol: "refinery machines now display ballon alerts & plays sounds more frequently when processing boulders for better feedback"
  - bugfix: "vents now spawn boulders of all sizes & not just small ones"
  - bugfix: "expanded gulag boulders now have correct materials in them."
  - bugfix: "manual tapping of vents now has a cooldown applied as intended."
  - bugfix: "BRM has its light turned off when area power goes off"
  - bugfix: "boulders ejected from refineries by hand no longer teleport all over the place occasionally."
  - bugfix: "refineries no longer eject boulders with 0 durability"
  - bugfix: "Boulders & refineries no longer pile up on top of BRM's & refineries in long rounds. Their locs have to be clear of boulders before they spit out more boulders to prevent a large pile of boulders from causing lag"
  - bugfix: "sheets ejected from lathes no longer get rejected when inserted back which could happen at random, no more boulders with empty materials"
  - code_imp: "splits boulder types into its own file along with other items"
  - code_imp: "merges & autodocs procs, vars related to boulders"
  - refactor: "repaths BRM to a simpler subtype"
  - refactor: "BRM now spawns boulders in batches(batch size can be increased with upgraded parts) with a boulder appearing every second. After a batch is processed a 3 second cooldown is applied to stop the conveyer belt from clogging up, With this BRM wires are removed as there is no need for timers to be attached to wires which intefers without our batch processing timings."
